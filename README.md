# CS4210-ML-Project

The topic of this project is to focus on predicting traffic. Dealing with heavy traffic can
cause unexpected delays, leading to more time wasted on the road, tardiness, and other possible
issues. The objective is to train multiple accurate machine learning models using supervised
learning techniques to classify road traffic at various levels of severity. The second objective is to
compare the performance of the models. Along with being able to accurately classify traffic, we
aim to discover which factors have the most impact on traffic severity.
